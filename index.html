    <h1>Git Version Control System</h1>
    <p>This is where Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCSs) step in. In a DVCS (such as Git, Mercurial, Bazaar or Darcs), 
        clients donâ€™t just check out the latest snapshot of the files; rather, they fully mirror the repository, including its full history. 
        Thus, if any server dies, and these systems were collaborating via that server, any of the client repositories can be copied back up to 
        the server to restore it. Every clone is really a full backup of all the data.</p>
